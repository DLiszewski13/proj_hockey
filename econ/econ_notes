Analysis on Regular Season Predictors of Winning in the NHL Playoffs


PAPERS TO MENTION
- Asia hockey games
    - Basic determanints of wins and losses in hockey
    - building off their work, instead using playoff and full regular season data (not game data)

- NBA relative regular season to post performance
    - my exact idea
    - absrtact good for idea, title to copy, etc.

- Factors contributing to ice hockey winning games
    - Similar to asia file
    - use abstract for which variables to use for example, explain why his model was bad using in game data

STEPS:
- Base Mode: logistic regression:
    - Predictor: (homeTeamPts - AwayTeamPts)
- logistic regression: (1 = win series, 0 = lose series)
    - look at predictors, t-tests, F-tests, 
    - compare models with different predictors: psuedo-R^2, 
    - come out with a "best model" for the playoffs
        - explain effect of significant predictors, which are most relevant predictors
- If time:
    - compare change of model over time (pre and post salary cap)
        - research "competitive balance" for this section
        
FUTURE & LIMITATIONS:
- changes over time: rule changes
- order logit for the model
- game level data for use of advanced statistics
- analysis of different rounds in the playoffs
