##### NOTES #####

remove 1998 and 1999 from the data? 
- only 27 teams in 1998 and 28 in 1999

figure out a better way to DRY 
- especially with filtering of the year variable 

teams in 1998 ties (T) column, 1999-2003 have T and OTL, 2005-2011 have OTL

add goals per game, GA per game, for regular season, playoffs, series

add PK%, PP% for regular season 

add save% for goalies (consider empty nets?), and playoffs sv%

a variable for being 'hot' coming into playoffs
- march and april points per game maybe?
- dummy variable?
- points per game much greater than the first 2/4 of year?

add a base home win rate col, and each teams home win rate col? (since each teams is slightly random)

to compute the effect of a regressor (variable), look at chapter in econ on logistic

Learn:
- did this randonmess always exist (compare 1998 - 2004 and 2005-2011 for example)
    - pre and post salary cap minimum 
    - possibly check out the high goal scoring years?
- which predictors are most important for playoff success

Things to explain:
- only using data 1998 - 2011 due to the same playoff format


STEPS:
- decide on a way to organize script code (function vs timeline)
- create new variables for each dataset
    - includes playoff win/loss (1 / 0)
- decide on a modeling process
    - stanley cup winner based on the 16 playoff teams, but how?
        - predict win percentage for each team in a series, then the probability they win the next round? 
        - or do I need game data??
        - or do I just do it with only the data from their overall season (and recent play) to guess hey             they'll win this round, but not the next or something, idk.......
