##### Project Proposal Review Meeting #####

Friday, 3/20, 1:00

LOOK into other papers on nhl playoff success, did they use similar patterns? should I go about this in a different way?

Questions:

 - DRY versus readability?
    - looking specifically at the fact I need to (filter > 1997) but also do different things to each             dataset
 - How do you want our R scripts to look?
    - chronological? or different sections? (Tidy section, trasnforming / exploring, etc.)
 - I want to use the model selection process for my ECON class
    - interpreting variable coefficient meaning, size effect, t-tests, etc.
 - How do I turn winner / loser of series into 1 and 0 while maintaining Tidy data?
